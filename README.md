This is my "homework" from Aquent Gymnasium's tutorial on Responsive Web Design. The tutorial teaches coding RWD from scratch.

My work is found under the "portfolio" directory; within this directory is the tutorial's "completed" version.

My spin on this tutorial, apart from changing the sample text to reflect my name and the headshot(s) to reflect me, is the use of PHP to cover repetitive elements of the project, using loops and a mock data source.
